##Secondary Index Design Document


###Overview

This document describes the High Level Design for Secondary Indexes. It also describes the deployement options supported.

###Components

- __Projector__

  The Projector is responsible for mapping mutations to a set of Secondary Key Versions. The Projector can reside within the master KV node in which the mutation is generated or it can reside in separate node. It receives mutations from ep-engine through UPR protocol and sends the evaluated results to Router.  [Details](markdown/projector.md)

- __Router__

  The Router is responsible for sending Key Version to the index nodes. It relies on the index distribution/partitioning topology to determine the indexer which should receive the key version. The router resides in the same node as the projector.  [Details](markdown/router.md)

- __Index Manager__

  The index manager is responsible for receiving requests for indexing operations (creation, deletion, maintenance, scan/lookup). The Index Manager is located in the index node, which can be different from KV node. Index Manager runs in one indexer node as **Index Coordinator Master** and in few other configurable nodes as **Index Coordinator Replica**. In rest of the nodes, it runs in dormant mode.  [Details](markdown/index_manager.md)

- __Indexer__ (Local Indexer)

  The indexer processes the key versions received from router and provides persistence support for the index. Indexer also provides the interface for query client to run index Scans and does scatter/gather for queries. The indexer would reside in index node.

- __Query Catalog__

  This component provides catalog implementation for the Query Server. This component resides in the same node Query Server is running and allows Query Server to perform Index DDL (Create, Drop) and Index Scan/Stats operations.

###Deployment

- [Deployment Options](markdown/deployment.md)

###Partition Management
* Milestone1 will have Key-based partitioning support. 
  * [John's Doc for Partitioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eF3rJ63iv1awnfLkAQLmVmILBdgD4Vzc0IsCpTxmXgY/edit)

###Communication Protocols

* Projector and Ep-Engine Protocol
  * [UPR protocol](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/cbupr/blob/master/index.md) will be used to talk to Ep-engine in KV. 
  
* Router and Indexer Protocol
* Query and Indexer Protocol
  * [Existing REST Based Protocol](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j9D4ryOi1d5CNY5EkoRuU_fc5Q3i_QwIs3zU9uObbJY/edit)

###Storage Management
ForestDB will be used as the persistent storage layer for secondary indexes for Beta release.
The design is Storage Independent and other storage solutions can be plugged-in.
Storage layer is expected to allow storage/read of snapshots to allow stable view of data.

[John's ForestDB Requirement Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zUJDLSrX7PPNfWopyoY1QIm5Y6CQL0h9iueoTZJtbT8/edit#).

###Cluster Management
* Master Election
* Communication with ns_server

###Metadata Management
**Metadata(aka StateContext)** is managed by *Index Coordinator Master* and synchronously replicated to its *Replicas*
for failure recovery. <br>
As an illustration of synchronous replication, please see [Initial Index Build Prepare Phase](markdown/initialbuild.md)

###Recovery
* [John's Recovery Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_zWRJ_VmbZZ1x925lUqunipuTzCJJMsqejtUrbtmVTA/edit)
