following are the arguments that can be adjusted for projector sizing:

    "projector.dcp.dataChanSize": 10000,
        channel size for DCP's data path routines,
        changing this value does not affect existing feeds.

    "projector.dcp.numConnections": 4,
        connect with N concurrent DCP connection with KV.

    "projector.mutationChanSize": 500,
        channel size of projector's vbucket workers,
        changing this value does not affect existing feeds.

    "projector.vbucketWorkers": 64,
        number of vbuckets to be handled by a single worker.

    "projector.dataport.keyChanSize": 100000,
        channel size of dataport endpoints data input,
        does not affect existing feeds.

To get an approximate estimation for projector sizing:

    ((dataChanSize * numConnections) + dataChanSize) * (key_size + document_size)
    +
    (mutationChanSize * vbucketWorkers) * (key_size + document_size)
    +
    (keyChanSize * index_entry_size)

For Example,

with the above default configuration and following number:
key_size: 64 bytes
doc_size: 10 KBytes
index_entry_size: 128 bytes

projector memory consumption should be ~832MB for buffers, plus GC memory. GC
memory shall vary between golang version.

Note that above calculation is for per bucket per indexer node. For example,
if there are 5 buckets and 5 indexer node, with following index distribution

    index1 on bucket A in indexer1
    index2 on bucket B in indexer2
    index3 on bucket C in indexer3
    index4 on bucket D in indexer4
    index5 on bucket D in indexer5
    index6 on bucket E in indexer1
    index7 on bucket E in indexer2
    index8 on bucket E in indexer3
    index9 on bucket E in indexer4
    index10 on bucket E in indexer5

then each projector should consume ~800MB * (3+2+5), plus GC memory. And the
worst case consumption, if all indexer nodes host an index from all buckets,
would be ~800MB * (5 * 5)
