* How to handle missing value ?

* Are we going to differentiate between float and integer ?
  Looks like dparval is parsing input json's number type as all float values.

* JSON supports integers of arbitrary size ? If so how to do collation on
  big-integers ?
  Even big-integers are parsed are returned as float by dparval.

* Sort order for arrays, should length of array be compared before comparing
  elements of arrays.

* Encoding and decoding of utf8 strings.

* In parse.go, using the parser combinator for builtin json parsing, use
  built in sort instead of a dumb bubble sort.

* Remove CollateJSON code and create a dependancy on tuqtng

* Write bench marks cases for worst case and best case endcoding and decoding
  for integer and float.
